# Future Efforts

This doc is a way to keep track of ideas, beyond the initial scope of the project, regarding improvements and additions.
(In no particular order)

## CSS/SCSS Integration

Add a way of scaffording some base css for applications that is in line with the overarching goals ( small and performant)

* [Big list of projects](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/)
* [mourner/dead-simple-grid](https://github.com/mourner/dead-simple-grid)
* [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton)

## Theme builder

* Define all the variables use in a light theme
* Extrapolate variables to a generator page

## Structure convention for commits
* [Vue commit convention](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) 

## Branching model
* [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

## Starter components

Create a suite of types of components that use the framework

* Basic: Nav, Pagination, Collapse, Accordion, Table
* Medium: PopOver, Tooltip, Toast Notification
* Advanced: Dropdown, Typehead, Carousel, Modal

The components have to be:
* Modular( they can installed individually)
* Small Additions with as litle code as possible
* **NO** external dependecies
